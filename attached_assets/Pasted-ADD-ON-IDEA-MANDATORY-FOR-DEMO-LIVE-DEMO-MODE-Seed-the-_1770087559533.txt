ADD-ON IDEA (MANDATORY FOR DEMO): “LIVE DEMO MODE” – Seed the main journey as In-Progress (In Transit) so you can complete it during the demo

Enhance the demo seed so it supports TWO modes:
- MODE_A: FULLY_COMPLETED (default) → the whole journey ends at Delivered + Paid + Closed
- MODE_B: LIVE_DEMO (recommended) → the main journey is created up to “IN_TRANSIT” with invoice already Issued, then you complete Delivery + Payment during the live demo

Implementation:
1) Add an environment flag or seed arg:
- DEMO_MODE=FULLY_COMPLETED | LIVE_DEMO
OR a CLI arg: `npm run seed -- --mode=LIVE_DEMO`

2) In LIVE_DEMO:
- Create the same linked entities (Customer → Order → Batch → DoseUnits → Shipment → Driver → Invoice)
but stop at these statuses:
A) Order:
  - status = DISPATCHED (not DELIVERED yet)
B) Shipment:
  - status = IN_TRANSIT
  - include 1–2 checkpoint ShipmentEvents (“Picked up”, “Leaving facility”, “On the way”)
C) Proof of Delivery:
  - DO NOT create POD yet (so driver can deliver it during demo)
D) Invoice:
  - status = ISSUED_POSTED
  - paidAmount = 0
  - remainingAmount = total
E) Payment:
  - Do NOT confirm payments yet
  - Optionally create 1 PaymentRequest as “DRAFT” or do not create any, so customer submits it during demo

3) Provide a “Demo Actions” Panel (Admin-only) to complete the flow quickly:
Create /admin/demo/actions with buttons:
- “Mark shipment ARRIVED”
- “Mark shipment DELIVERED + create POD”
- “Generate PaymentRequest (partial)”
- “Confirm PaymentRequest”
- “Generate second PaymentRequest (remaining)”
- “Confirm final payment and close invoice”
Each action must:
- update statuses using existing transition APIs (don’t bypass logic)
- create events in timelines
- trigger notifications to customer/logistics/driver/finance

4) Driver Portal Demo Support
In LIVE_DEMO mode, ensure the driver user:
- sees the shipment assigned and in transit
- can open it and complete:
  - ARRIVED → DELIVERED with POD capture (signature/photo + GPS)
This will update:
- shipment journey
- order journey
- customer portal tracking
- notifications

5) README Demo Script
Add a “Live Demo Walkthrough” section:
Step 1: Login as customer portal → view order tracking (in transit)
Step 2: Login as driver → deliver with POD
Step 3: Customer portal → see Delivered + download invoice PDF
Step 4: Customer submits partial payment request
Step 5: Finance confirms → receipt voucher generated
Step 6: Customer pays remaining → finance confirms → invoice paid/closed

Acceptance Criteria:
- LIVE_DEMO mode starts with at least 1 order in progress and visible on dashboards/queues.
- You can complete delivery + payment during the demo, and all linked pages update correctly with logs and notifications.
