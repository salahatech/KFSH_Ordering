You are Replit AI acting as a senior full-stack engineer.

Goal:
Create realistic DEMO DATA (seed + optional “Generate Demo” button) that covers the FULL process from:
Customer Portal Order → Validation → Scheduling → Batch → QC → QP Release → Dispensing → Shipment/Driver → Delivery with POD
…and also generates Invoice → Customer Payment Request → Finance Confirmation → Receipt Voucher.
Base currency SAR, with cost centers enabled.

Tech:
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Node.js (NestJS/Express)
- React app already exists
- Provide idempotent seed script (can be re-run safely)

========================================================
1) DEMO SCENARIO REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Create ONE main end-to-end journey (happy path) plus a few side examples.
The data must be linked properly:
Customer → Customer Users → Orders → Batch → DoseUnits → Shipment → Driver → POD → Invoice → PaymentRequest → ReceiptVoucher
Also create the related events/timelines so the “Journey” UI pages show meaningful logs.

========================================================
2) MASTER DATA TO SEED (MANDATORY)

2.1 Company / Seller Info (for invoice + ZATCA QR)
- sellerName = "RadioPharma Demo Co."
- sellerVatNo = "310000000000003"   (demo-like 15 digits)
- sellerCrNo  = "1010123456"
- sellerAddress = "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"

2.2 Cost Centers (SAR)
- CC100 Production
- CC110 QC Lab
- CC120 Logistics
- CC200 Sales
- CC300 Admin

2.3 Users + Roles
Create users with passwords (document in README):
- admin@demo.com (ADMIN)
- orderdesk@demo.com (ORDER_DESK / VALIDATOR)
- planner@demo.com (PLANNER)
- qc@demo.com (QC_ANALYST)
- qp@demo.com (QP)
- logistics@demo.com (LOGISTICS)
- finance@demo.com (FINANCE_ADMIN)

Driver user:
- driver1@demo.com (DRIVER) linked to Driver record

Customer portal users (linked to a customer):
- portal1@hospitaldemo.com (CUSTOMER) linked to Customer A
- portal2@hospitaldemo.com (CUSTOMER_BILLING optional) linked to Customer A

2.4 Customer (with Arabic name + docs)
Customer A:
- nameEn: "Al Noor Hospital"
- nameAr: "مستشفى النور"
- fullAddress: "King Fahd Rd, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"
- city: "Riyadh"
- country: "Saudi Arabia"
- mobile: +9665xxxxxxxx (valid)
- email: billing@hospitaldemo.com
- crNumber, taxNumber (valid-looking)
- GPS lat/lng (Riyadh approx)
- LogoUrl placeholder
- Documents (max 5MB metadata only): CR, TAX_CERT, LICENSE

2.5 Products (sellable + producible)
Create at least 3 products with half-life fields and QC templates:
- FDG (PET) sellable+producible, method CYCLOTRON
- Tc-99m MDP (SPECT) sellable+producible, method GENERATOR or KIT_PREP
- I-131 (Therapy) sellable+producible, method THERAPEUTIC_LABELING
Each product must have:
- Selling tab config: SKU, sellingUOM, revenueAccount (or stub), default cost center, VAT rate
- Production recipe (BOM) v1 active with 3–6 materials and qty/uom/cost per unit

2.6 Price List (SAR)
Create price list “Default SAR 2026” with items:
- FDG: per dose or per activity (pick one and be consistent)
- Tc-99m MDP
- Delivery fee item (optional)

2.7 Capacity Windows (if minutes-based)
For next 7 days create DeliveryWindows for DISPENSING_BOTTLENECK:
- 08:00–12:00 (240 minutes)
- 13:00–17:00 (240 minutes)
Add TimeStandard minutesRequired per product per dose.

========================================================
3) END-TO-END HAPPY PATH DATA (MANDATORY)
Create a single “golden journey”:

3.1 Reservation (optional if capacity enabled)
- Reservation HELD then CONFIRMED for Customer A:
  product FDG, quantity = 4 doses
  reservedMinutes = minutesRequired * 4
  window = tomorrow morning

3.2 Order (Customer portal created)
- Order O-10001:
  customerId = Customer A (from portal user link)
  product = FDG
  delivery date/time = tomorrow 10:30
  injection time = tomorrow 11:00
  requested activity
  status journey:
    DRAFT → SUBMITTED → VALIDATED → SCHEDULED → IN_PRODUCTION → QC_PENDING → RELEASED → DISPATCHED → DELIVERED
- Create OrderStatusEvents with realistic timestamps spaced by minutes/hours.

3.3 Batch
- Batch B-20001 linked to O-10001
  status journey:
    PLANNED → IN_PRODUCTION → PRODUCTION_COMPLETE → QC_PENDING → QC_PASSED → RELEASED
- Add BatchEvents and material consumption snapshot from product recipe.

3.4 QC Results
- Create Sample + TestResults for required tests (pass)
- QC events:
  “Sample taken”, “Results entered”, “QC passed”

3.5 QP Release
- Create e-signature record for batch RELEASED
- Enforce SoD (QP user differs from QC user)

3.6 Dose Units
- Create 4 DoseUnits for order:
  statuses: PLANNED → DISPENSED → PACKED → SHIPPED
- Generate labelData JSON minimal

3.7 Shipment + Driver + Schedule
- Shipment S-30001:
  scheduledPickupAt tomorrow 09:45
  scheduledDeliveryAt tomorrow 10:30
  linked to DoseUnits and Order
  assigned to Driver 1
  status journey:
    PACKED → ASSIGNED_TO_DRIVER → ACCEPTED_BY_DRIVER → PICKED_UP → IN_TRANSIT → ARRIVED → DELIVERED
- Add ShipmentEvents with timestamps
- Create ProofOfDelivery:
  receiverName + deliveredAt + gps + signature/photo placeholders

3.8 Invoice + Payment + Receipt Voucher
- Invoice INV-40001 generated by trigger ON_DELIVERED (or configured trigger):
  statuses:
    DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → ISSUED_POSTED → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID → CLOSED_ARCHIVED
- Create Payment Agreement allowing partial payment.

Customer actions:
- PaymentRequest PR-50001 (partial): amount = 50% of invoice, status PENDING_CONFIRMATION
Finance confirms → ReceiptVoucher RV-60001 created → invoice becomes PARTIALLY_PAID

- PaymentRequest PR-50002 (remaining): status PENDING_CONFIRMATION
Finance confirms → ReceiptVoucher RV-60002 created → invoice becomes PAID and CLOSED_ARCHIVED

Ensure invoice list shows:
- total, paid, remaining

========================================================
4) ADDITIONAL MINI DEMO CASES (RECOMMENDED)
Create a few extra records to demonstrate filters/exceptions:
- Order O-10002: QC failed → FAILED_QC (no shipment)
- Shipment S-30002: delayed → DELAYED (not yet delivered)
- Invoice INV-40002: overdue unpaid
- Batch B-20002: ON_HOLD

========================================================
5) NOTIFICATIONS + EVENTS (MANDATORY)
For the happy path generate notifications for:
- Order submitted/validated/scheduled
- Batch QC passed
- Batch released
- Shipment assigned to driver, dispatched, delivered
- Invoice issued
- Payment submitted, payment confirmed, invoice fully paid
Store them so top bar + notification center show items for:
- Customer portal user
- logistics user
- driver user
- finance user

========================================================
6) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (MANDATORY)
- Create a seed script: prisma/seed.ts
- Seed must be idempotent:
  - upsert by unique keys (email, codes, invoiceNo, orderNo, batchNo, shipmentNo, etc.)
- Use realistic timestamps:
  - today and tomorrow in Asia/Riyadh timezone, store UTC in DB
- After seeding, print in console:
  - portal user credentials
  - internal user credentials
  - the main order number and links to key pages

Optional:
- Add Admin button “Generate Demo Data” that calls POST /admin/demo/seed
  - Protected to ADMIN only

========================================================
7) README DEMO FLOW (MANDATORY)
Add a README section:
- Login as portal customer → create/view order O-10001 journey + shipment tracking + invoice + receipts
- Login as logistics → view shipment S-30001, driver assignment
- Login as driver → accept/pickup/deliver (already completed in seed, but can show history)
- Login as finance → see invoice INV-40001 and payment confirmations and receipts

Acceptance Criteria:
- A user can follow ONE complete journey from customer order to delivery and payment proof without missing links.
- All journey/timeline pages show events and status progression.
- Lists and dashboards have meaningful data for filters and widgets.
