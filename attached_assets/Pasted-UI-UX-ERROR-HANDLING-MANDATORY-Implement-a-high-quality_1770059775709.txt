UI/UX ERROR HANDLING (MANDATORY)

Implement a high-quality error handling and messaging system that is meaningful for end users and consistent across the app.

1) Error Strategy (Backend → Frontend)
- Backend must return standardized error responses:
  {
    "code": "ORDER_TIME_NOT_FEASIBLE",
    "message": "Delivery time is not feasible for this product’s shelf life.",
    "userMessage": "We can’t deliver this dose at the selected time. Please choose an earlier delivery/injection time or reduce requested activity.",
    "details": { ... },
    "fieldErrors": [{ "field": "deliveryTime", "message": "Select an earlier time." }],
    "traceId": "uuid"
  }
- Never expose stack traces or internal DB errors to end users.
- Log technical error details server-side with traceId for support.

2) Frontend UX Rules
- Show errors in a user-friendly tone: what happened, why, and how to fix it.
- Use inline validation for form fields (field-level errors).
- Use a top-of-form summary for multiple errors (with jump-to-field).
- Use non-blocking toast/snackbar for transient errors (e.g., “Failed to load orders. Retry”).
- Use dedicated empty/error states for pages (with Retry button).
- Use confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (cancel order, reject batch, etc.).
- On success, show concise confirmation (toast) and update UI immediately.

3) Validation Layers
- Client-side validation: required fields, date/time format, numeric ranges.
- Server-side validation: licensing, product permission, scheduling feasibility, status transitions.
- Prevent invalid state transitions with clear messages (e.g., “You can’t dispatch before QP release.”)

4) Meaningful Domain-Specific Errors (Examples to Implement)
- LICENSE_EXPIRED:
  "Customer license expired on {date}. Renew license to place orders."
- PRODUCT_NOT_PERMITTED:
  "This customer is not authorized to order {product}."
- ORDER_TIME_NOT_FEASIBLE:
  "Selected injection/delivery time is too late for {product}. Choose an earlier time."
- CAPACITY_FULL:
  "Production capacity is full for {date}. Try another slot or split the order."
- QC_FAILED:
  "QC failed for this batch. Orders cannot be dispatched. Create rework if time allows."
- INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION:
  "This action isn’t allowed right now. Current status: {status}."

5) Error Component System (Frontend)
- Create reusable components:
  - <InlineFieldError />
  - <FormErrorSummary />
  - <Toast /> notifications
  - <ErrorStatePage title messa
